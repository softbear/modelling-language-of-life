# modelling-language-of-life
 
*Work in progress*

We can reframe gene regulation as a language modelling problem. This is an attempt to use Transformers to implicitly learn the rules of gene expression orders.
The repository currently contains a script to process gene expression data into an ordered sequence format, and a fork of the Performer Transformer (as implemented by @lucidrains).
